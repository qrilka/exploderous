# Exploderous

An original Bomberman-inspired game in Rust, with correctness as a first-class goal.

## Development

Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Cargo commands automatically provision the Rust version, `rustfmt`, and `clippy` pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`, both locally and in CI:

```sh
cargo run -p exploderous-tui --locked
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets --locked
```

The root is a virtual workspace. The Bomb playground is `crates/tui` (package `exploderous-tui`) and requires a terminal with Kitty keyboard-protocol support. Arrow keys move, Space places a Bomb, R resets, and Q/Escape quits; `h` opens paused help. Each run overwrites `app.log` with terminal events, per-tick movement/placement inputs and positions, and catch-up/error records; pasted contents are redacted. The headless simulation lives in `crates/core` (package `exploderous-core`); root-level check commands cover all workspace members. CI runs formatting, Clippy (warnings fail), and tests on pushes and pull requests.

## Project status and direction

The headless core and TUI support movement, Bomb placement, and Blasts that clear Blocks. Blasts are not yet lethal, and there is no Exit objective. The next broad milestone is a complete playable Normal level; see the [project plan](docs/project-plan.md). Feature scope and acceptance gates are tracked in GitHub issues, while lasting gameplay rules live in the design.
